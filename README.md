## This is the official repository of MUSIC (Multitask Learning Under Sparse and Incomplete Constraints)

This repository contains four folders, one for each of the coupled systems in the paper. Each folder contains multiple files that include a python notebook containing the model training, a sample trained model that can be directly used to replicate some results in the paper, and any relevant datatset (if applicable).

If you want to run the training, please directly download the folder of your choice and run the respective .ipynb notebook. 

The details of compute resources used in training of these models along with time taken for each of the models is given below.
